React Grid Overview
---------------------

The "ag" part of ag-Grid stands for "agnostic". The internal ag-Grid engine is implemented in plain JavaScript[1] and has zero dependencies. ag-Grid supports React through a wrapper component. The React wrapper lets you use ag-Grid in your application like any other React component â€“ you pass configuration through properties and handle events through callbacks. You can even use React components to customize the grid UI and cell contents / behavior.
